# Networking Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

Welcome to the Networking Algorithms Implementation repository! This collection of Python scripts showcases practical implementations of fundamental networking algorithms. Leveraging the power of Python and socket programming, these scripts delve into various aspects of computer networking.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - *Description:* This module features a basic DNS server and client, illustrating the translation of domain names to IP addresses. Dive into the world of domain resolution with this implementation.

2. **TCP Reno**
   - *Description:* Explore the realm of congestion control with this implementation of the TCP Reno algorithm. Witness how this widely used TCP variant manages network congestion for reliable data transfer.

3. **TCP Flow Control and Congestion Control**
   - *Description:* Delve into the intricacies of TCP with this script, showcasing both flow control and congestion control mechanisms. Gain insights into how TCP manages data flow and responds to network conditions.

4. **Distance Vector Routing**
   - *Description:* Uncover the functionality of the Distance Vector routing algorithm in this module. Learn how routers exchange routing information to determine the optimal paths for data transmission.

5. **Link State Algorithm (LSA)**
   - *Description:* Routing takes center stage with the Link State Algorithm implementation. This script demonstrates how routers disseminate information about the state of network links, aiding in efficient routing decisions.

6. **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**
   - *Description:* This module introduces a basic implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Gain insights into how BGP facilitates communication between different autonomous systems on the internet.
